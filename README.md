# Tuneify

A work in progress...at the moment this is still a basic boilerplate

A project to fully explore building a real world universal/isomorphic React/Redux app.

## Tech used:

* React
* React Router
* Redux
* Webpack
* ES6 / Babel
* Node (express)
* Mongodb
* PostCss

##Installation

Clone repo and then:

```
npm i
```

Then change to the app directory and run:

```
npm start
```

This kicks the Webpack dev server off on port 1111 and enables hot loading.

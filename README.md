# Tuneify

A project to fully explore building a real world universal/isomorphic React/Redux app. The idea is that a streaming music app can be built using the LastFm and YouTube Apis. Current progress is a functioning autocomplete that leverages the LastFm Api to pull back artist, album and track results. 

This repository is currently a work in progress - at the moment this is still a basic boilerplate.

## Tech used:

* React
* React Router / React Router Redux
* Redux
* Webpack
* ES6 / Babel
* Node (express)
* Mongodb
* PostCss / Css modules
* Testing on Karma / Phantom / Mocha / Chai

##Installation

Clone repo and then:

```
npm i
```

Then change to the app directory and run:

```
npm start
```

This kicks the Webpack dev server off on port 1111 and enables hot loading.

The band is composed of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano, beats), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboard, other instruments), Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals), Colin Greenwood (bass guitar) and Phil Selway (drums, percussion).\n\nThe early years (1992 – 1995)\nRadiohead released their first single, \"Creep\" in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993).  Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). The band's textured guitar parts and Yorke's falsetto singing were warmly received by critics and fans. \n\nInternational success (1996 - 2000)\nRadiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer has often been acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s.\n\nA change in style and leaving EMI (2000 – 2003)\nKid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked a change in the band's musical style. Radiohead incorporated experimental electronic music, Krautrock, post-punk and jazz influences into their songs, dividing fans and critics, but they remained popular. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of guitar-driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by headlines, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI. \n\nIndependent releases and touring (2005 - 2013)\nIn 2007, Radiohead independently released their seventh album, In Rainbows, originally as a digital download for which each customer could set their own price, later in stores, to critical and chart success.\n\nIn 2011, Radiohead released their eighth album, The King of Limbs - again independently - which was described as an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures.\n\nIn February 2012, Radiohead began The King of Limbs world tour - with concerts in the US, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. In early 2013, following the tour, Thom Yorke released a studio album entitled Amok with his band Atoms for Peace.\n\nNinth Studio Album - \"A Moon Shaped Pool\"  (2016)\nAfter much speculation, on May 8, 2016, Radiohead released their long awaited ninth album,\"A Moon Shaped Pool\" on various streaming services. The band announced the release of their latest 11-track album on Twitter. The first track from the album was \"Burn the Witch\".\n\nGlastonbury 2017\nOn October 20, 2016, Radiohead was announced as the headline act for the opening night at Glastonbury Music Festival in June 2017. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
